                   -- PONG PLANNING EXERCISE --

USER STORY/GAMEPLAY:

=== Describe the gampelay ===
- Pong is a two-player game in which each player has control of a single paddle,
  placed on opposite sides of the screen.
- The players hit the ball back and forth using the paddle and are limited by the
  top and bottom boundaries. The ball bounces off until a player hits it.

=== What are the conditions when the game begins? ===
- If a player misses the ball, they lose a point.
- The ball bounces off the borders, but someone has to hit the ball back in and
  hope the other person misses in order to get the point.

=== Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends? ===
- Yes, the game ends after a player earns 11 points.

=== What "if"s will there be? ===
- Conditions for game ending:
    if (scoreP1 === 11) {
        prompt("GAME OVER: Player 1 wins!");
    } else if (scoreP2 === 11) {
        prompt("GAME OVER: Player 2 wins!")
    }

- Conditions for which paddle is being controlled:
  - WASD and arrow keys like in Walker projec
    - There are only up and down keys since the paddle can't go left or right
        //CONTROLS FOR PLAYER 1
        if (event.which === KEY.W) {
            //insert code here    
        } else if (event.which === KEY.S) {
            //insert code here
        }
        //CONTROLS FOR PLAYER 2
        if (event.which === KEY.UP) {
            //insert code here
        } else if (event.which === KEY.DOWN) {
            //insert code here
        }

- Conditions for the ball being hit (by paddle or off wall):
  - Ball bounces off to the other direction
  - Other player's score goes up because the player missed if it hits the wall

        //if the ball's position is greater than the board's width, the ball bounces
        back in the right direction
        if (ballPositionX > boardWidth - ballWidth) {
            ballSpeedX = ballSpeedX * -1;
            //since the ball bounced off the wall, that means the other player missed,
            and the person who hit the ball wins the point
            scoreP1++;
        
        //if the ball's position is less than 0, the ball must bounce back off the
        wall in order for it to not fly off the screen
        } else if (positionX < 0) {
            ballSpeedX = ballSpeedX * -1;
            //since the ball bounced off the wall, that means the other player missed,
            and the person who hit the ball wins the point
            scoreP2++;
        }
  
     -- (NOT SURE ABOUT THIS SECTION OF POSSIBLE CODE - JUST BRAINSTORMING) --
  - Ball hitting paddle should require:
    - (ballPositionX === boardWidth - paddleWidth*2)
    //doubling the width to account for space paddle occupies inside the boardWidth
    //the position must be equal to the paddleWidth's in order for it to touch
    - ball's position must be within the height of the paddle in order for the ball
      to touch the paddle -> if the position is outside, then it hits the wall
    - either way, it should require the ball to bounce in the opposite direction

VISUAL GAME COMPONENTS:

=== What are the visual game components? ===
- Animated:
  - ball
  - paddles
- Static:
  - boundary (dotted line in the center)
  - background

=== What data will you need to manage each game component? ===
- Position
  - player 1 position -> positionP1
  - player 2 position -> positionP2
- Speed 
  - Speed of both players will most likely be the same
  - player 1 speed (horizontal) -> speedXP1
  - player 2 speed (horizontal) -> speedXP2
  - player 1 speed (vertical) -> speedYP1
  - player 2 speed (vertical) -> speedYP2
- Score
  - player 1 points -> scoreP1
  - player 2 points -> scoreP2

EVENTS/LOGIC:

=== What events will occur in this game? ===
- Keyboard events
  - WASD key response
  - arrow key response

- Ball hitting paddle and wall

=== How do those events affect the data of the program? ===
- When the WASD keys are clicked:
    1. The paddle has to move in the correct direction
    2. ONLY player 1's paddle should move
- When the arrow keys are clicked:
    1. The paddle has to move in the correct direction
    2. ONLY player 2's paddle should move
- When the ball hits the wall:
    1. The player in the opposite direction gets an additional point added 
       to their score.
    2. The ball should reverse direction after hitting the wall.
    3. Game should go on uninterrupted until the end (may change depending on what
       the to-do's call for).
- When the ball hits the paddle:
    1. The ball should bounce off the paddle, reversing direction.
    2. Game should go on uninterrupted until the end (may change depending on what
       the to-do's call for).
